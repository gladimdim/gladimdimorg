If you liked *Unrailed!* for its simplicity in controls but sophisticated gameplay then *Sloboda 2* is for you as well! We specifically targeted the mobile platforms for their broad access to all persons and their availability any time you need them. The smartphone is always on you. **We merged Unrailed!, Minecraft and Settlers all into one awesome, gorgeous and fun bundle.** The core gameplay requires 3-4 hours to complete. Then you can do whatever you want. Or you can do whatever you want from the first seconds, the game does not limit you in any way.

# **Some dev stats**

We are a team of two people. And even more: a family 👦👧.

The journey started a year ago in Dec 2021 when we decided to remake our old game all done with Flutter.

We did official Unity courses at: [http://learn.unity.com](http://learn.unity.com) and after a couple of weeks started the work on our game. Each evening step by step, task by task we moved the needle towards this day. In parallel, we learnt the skills required to use Blender to make the art we wanted.

In the summer we redesigned almost all art from voxel to low-poly style. Then added 21 Game Center Achievements🌟 and Apple TV 📺 support. Together with ANY gamepad 🎮you have connected to your iPhone/Apple TV!
